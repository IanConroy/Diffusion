    <h1>Diffusion, at its finest...</h1>
    <p>In this document, I demonstrate and practice concepts I've been learning on
        The Odin Project (TOP) independently of anything there. This is above and beyond
        the typical scope of the curriculum, but I think this is a great way to work with new
        skills and ensure thorough understanding of the material.
