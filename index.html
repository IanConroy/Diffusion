    <h1>Diffusion, at its finest...</h1>
    <p>In this document, I demonstrate and practice concepts I've been learning on
        The Odin Project (TOP) independently of anything there. This is above and beyond
        the typical scope of the curriculum, but I think this is a great way to work with new
        skills and ensure thorough understanding of the material.

    <ul>
        <li><a href="loops.html">Loops</a></li>
        <li>let a = 7;<br>a += 3;<br>let b = 14;<br>b -= 4;</li>
    </ul>
    <h6>Now, here we take this:</h6>
    <article>
        <p>
            function locateGreater(x, y) {
                if(x > y) {
                    return "x is greater";
                }
                else {
                    return "y is greater or equal";
                }
            }
        </p>
    </article>
    <h6>And revise it to this to use a conditional, AKA ternary operator:</h6>
    <article>
        <p>
            function locateGreater(x, y) {
                return x > y ? "x is greater" : "y is greater or equal";
            }
        </p>
